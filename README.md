Arsenal Football Club, commonly referred to as Arsenal FC or simply Arsenal, is a professional football club based in Holloway, London, England. Established in 1886, Arsenal is one of the most successful clubs in English football history. Here's a brief introduction to the club:

Foundation: Arsenal was founded in 1886 by workers at the Royal Arsenal armaments factory in Woolwich, South London. Originally named Dial Square, the club was renamed Royal Arsenal shortly after.

Success: Arsenal has a rich history of success, particularly during the tenure of legendary manager Arsène Wenger, who managed the club from 1996 to 2018. Under Wenger, Arsenal won three Premier League titles and seven FA Cups, including two league and cup doubles in 1998 and 2002.

Support: Arsenal boasts a large and dedicated fan base, both domestically and internationally. The club's supporters are known for their passionate loyalty and fervent support during matches.

Rivalries: Arsenal has several notable rivalries, including with Tottenham Hotspur (the North London derby), Chelsea, and Manchester United. These matches are fiercely contested and carry significant importance for both sets of supporters.

Overall, Arsenal FC holds a storied legacy in English football, characterized by its success, style of play, and passionate fan base.

The overall aim of this project is to make quiz app which tests the knowledge of football fans on Arsenal FC. This project is inspired by my passion towards this club.

* [Chrome DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)

    - Chrome DevTools was used during the development process to test, explore and modify HTML elements and CSS styles used in the project.

![W3C HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/)
The HTML checker notified me an error in my quiz.html page such as the sections lacking heading. And so, I started using h2 and h3 elements. 

The identified errors in both pages were corrected by inspecting in ChromeDevTools.

## Credits

### Content

- All content was written by the developer.
- Format of the quiz was inspired by the Quiz on Coagulation in Water Treatment by dhakal79. Where I took inspiration from their dynamic javascript transitions of the hero images, for my home page and quiz page, as well as the layout of the multiple choice answer options. I then edited this and re-coded it in my own way, to suit my topic.
